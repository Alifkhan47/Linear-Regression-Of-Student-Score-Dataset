**Linear regression**
Linear regression is used to predict an outcome given some input value(s). While machine
learning classifiers use features to predict a discrete label for a given instance or example,
machine learning regressors have the ability use features to predict a continuous outcome
for a given instance or example. For example, a classifier might draw a decision boundary
that can tell you whether or not a house is likely to sell at a given price (when provided
with features of the house) but a regressor can use those same features to predict the market
value of the house. Nonetheless, regression is still a supervised learning technique and you
will still need to train your model on a set of examples with known outcomes.
